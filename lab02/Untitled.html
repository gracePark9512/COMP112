		<h1>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</h1>
		<p>(December 10, 1815 - November 27, 1852) is mainly known for having written a description of Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the analytical engine. Life Ada was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife, Annabella Milbanke.
		</P>
		<h3>In 1816</h3>
		<p> Annabella left Byron, taking 1-month old Ada with her. A few months later Byron signed the Deed of Separation and left England for good. He was never allowed to see either again. Lady Byron was very interested in mathematics (Lord Byron once called her "the queen of parallelograms"), which dominated her life, even after marriage. Her obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron was one of the reasons why Annabella taught Ada mathematics at an early age. Ada was privately schooled in mathematics and science; one of her tutors was Augustus De Morgan.
		</p>
		<h3>In 1835</h3>
		<p>Ada married William King, 8th Baron King, later 1st Earl of Lovelace. Her full name and title for most of her married life was The Right Honourable Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace. She is widely known in modern times simply as Ada Lovelace.Ada knew Mary Somerville, noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century, who introduced her in turn to Charles Babbage in 1833.

		<h3>During a nine moth period in 1842-1843</h3>
		<p>Ada translated for Babbage Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's memoir on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of Notes which specified in complete detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, recognized by historians as the <strong>world's first computer program</strong>. Biographers note, however, that the programs were written by Babbage himself, and Lovelace simply found a mistake in the program for calculating Bernoulli numbers and sent it back for amendment. The evidence and correspondence between Lovelace and Babbage indicate that he wrote all of the programs in the notes appended to the Menebrea translation.
		</P>
		<p>
			Her prose acknowledged some possibilities of the machine which Babbage never published, such as speculating that <blockquote>"the Engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent."

		<h3>Trivia On December 10, 1980</h3>
		<p>(Ada's birthday), the U.S. Defense Department approved the reference manual for their new computer programming language, called "Ada". The U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard for Ada (MIL-STD-1815) was assigned a number to commemorate the year of her birth.
